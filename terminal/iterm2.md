The usual, pre-installed Terminal application on `Mac OS` has quite limited customization and expansion options. 
There are several themes available to choose from, and downloading third-party ones is quite difficult. 
To solve this problem comes the iTerm2 application. There are many themes to choose from to use with it, you can create your own or 
customize someone else's.<br>

The Homebrew script is used for downloading: `brew install --cask iterm2`. After installing the terminal itself, 
I install the following extensions:
- `oh-my-zsh` to improve console interaction. The plugin provides the following functions:
   -`aliases` adds ability to create shortcuts, pre-installed for tree view(`l, ls, lsa`) and for github(`gaa, gp`). Documentation
-`git` This plugin supports working with GitHub from the command line. It provides several things:
   -Configures the hub shell and termination for the git command if you have hub installed.
   -Completion for github ruby stone.
   -Convenience functions for working with repositories and URLs.
And many, many (298) plugins that are immediately available for use. [Documentation](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/)
